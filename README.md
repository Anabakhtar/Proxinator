Are you tired of having to wake up early for online classes? do you wish for a program that automatically opens zoom/ms teams/google meets on your class timings and automatially logs into your class and plays a virtual video of you sitting there and even answers your attendance when the teacher takes roll call?
Sounds like magic right? Well, wiht Proxinator, its possible.
Ps. The aim of Proxinator is to teach people about the possibilities of python, not to support proxies or bunking classes. I would love people to experiment with Proxinator but i would not suggest using this in your classes. #useatyourownrisk (i am not responsible for your attendance)
